# WavefrontSimulator

This code simulates the deformation of a membrane due to electrostatic forces from an electrode array.  A membrane is a mathematically simple system, and for relatively small deformations, its shape is described by the Poisson equation.  This program numerically solves the Poisson equation for various electrode and device configurations.


This code is written in C++, and includes a GUI.  The main program unit is named Unit1.cpp.  Other modules implement an object oriented class structure.
